# Decimal to Binary Converter using Recursion
Overview
This project is a `decimal-to-binary converter` implemented in JavaScript using recursion. Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller sub-problems.

# Features
Converts decimal numbers to binary using recursion
Visual representation of the recursion process through animation

Open the project in your preferred code editor.
Navigate to the index.html file and open it in a web browser.
Enter a decimal number in the input field and press the "Convert" button.
Watch the animation as the decimal number is converted to binary using recursion.
